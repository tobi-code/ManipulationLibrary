# ManipulationLibrary

Introduction:
-------------
[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-blue.svg)](https://manipulationlibrary.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)


A module for Python 3 to work with eSEC matrices and extract e$^2$SEC matrices from manipulations. 

You can find examples on how to use this library in the "example" folder in GitHub.

	Disclaimer: This module is tested on Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS with Python 3.8.5

If you have trouble with the "filter_cython_new" function compile it on your system
with the following command in the "cython_filter_new" folder: ``python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace``

If the "filter_cython_new" can't be imported, comment out line 27 instead of line 26 in "manipulation_analyser.py".

How to use:
-----------

In order to analyse existing eSEC matrices, the "eSEC_analyser.py" module is used. In the example folder a Jupyter Notebook script is provided which shows how to:
* import the module
* read eSEc matricers from PDF
* plot the importance of rows
* check if any eSEC matrix is same as another one
* Remove combinations of relations (rows)
* plot a dendrogram and dissimilarity matrix for all manipulations
* plot a confusion matrix, classification accuacy with corresponding bar plot for e$^2$SEC matrices

The module "manipulation_analyser.py" is used to calculate eÂ²SEC matrices using the MANIAC dataset. An example Jupyter Notebook along with point cloud data and corresponding labels is provided in the example folder. From this example manipulation the e$^2$SEC matrices are extracted and saved along with the debug images.

Depends on external librabies:
------------------------------

* tabula

* progressbar

* pandas

* numpy

* matplotlib

* itertools

* scipy

* seaborn

* open3d

* OpenCV

* Cython

Installation of librabies:
--------------------------

To install these librabies use the following command:
	``pip3 install tabula matplotlib pandas numpy scipy seaborn open3d opencv-python cython progressbar2``

See the documentation at https://manipulationlibrary.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ for futher explanation of all functions.
